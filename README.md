#  Decision Tree Visualization with scikit-learn

This project helps you visually understand how a Decision Tree splits the dataset step-by-step, using Python, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

The notebook shows:

1] How decision boundaries are formed

2] How different features are used at different splits

3] Gini index vs entropy-based splitting

4] Graphical tree structure using plot_tree
